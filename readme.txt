== Description ==
In Easy Digital Downloads Software Licensing, you have the ability to add a changelog to your download. By default, this is not output on the download page.

This plugin will output the changelog in a collapsible format, which is accessible to users who are using their keyboard for navigation as opposed to a mouse.

Other plugins output the changelog, but do not do so in an accessible manner.
